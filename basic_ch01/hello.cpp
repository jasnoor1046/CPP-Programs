// This header file at the above provides the foundation for input and output operations
// It provides tools (classes and objects) to perform common I/O tasks i.e, reading data, writing data,
// formatting output i.e., to format how data is displayed. The stream based approach provides a consistent and flexible way
// to handle different data types
